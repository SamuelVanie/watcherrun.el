# Task ID: SUPPORT-001

**Title:** Create Basic Package Structure and Configuration

## Description
Set up the foundational Emacs Lisp package structure for WatcherRun according to 2025 best practices. This includes creating the main package file with proper headers, enabling lexical binding, and establishing the basic namespace structure.

**Step-by-step breakdown:**
1. Create the main `watcherrun.el` file in the project root
2. Add proper file header with lexical binding enabled
3. Set up package metadata (author, version, description, dependencies)
4. Define the main feature and provide statement
5. Establish consistent naming conventions with `watcherrun-` prefix

## Inputs
- Architecture documentation from `.mayuri/` folder
- Package structure requirements from architecture overview
- Current Emacs Lisp best practices (2025)

## Expected Output
- `watcherrun.el` file with complete package header
- Proper lexical binding configuration
- Package metadata properly defined
- Foundation for all subsequent components

## Estimated Time
2 hours

## Component
['support_components']

## Level
junior

## Best Practices / Notes
- **CRITICAL**: Start the file with `;;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-` on the very first line
- Use `;;; Code:` and `;;; watcherrun.el ends here` as standard delimiters
- Follow standard Emacs package header format with Package-Requires, Version, etc.
- All public functions must use `watcherrun-` prefix
- Private/internal functions should use `watcherrun--` prefix (double hyphen)
- Add proper GPL license header as standard for Emacs packages

**Example file structure:**
```elisp
;;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
;;; watcherrun.el --- Watch files and run commands when they change

;; Author: Your Name <email@example.com>
;; Version: 0.1.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "28.1"))
;; Keywords: convenience, files, processes
;; URL: https://github.com/user/watcherrun.el

;;; Commentary:
;; Your package description here

;;; Code:

(defgroup watcherrun nil
  "Watch files and run commands when they change."
  :group 'convenience)

;; Your code here

(provide 'watcherrun)
;;; watcherrun.el ends here
```
