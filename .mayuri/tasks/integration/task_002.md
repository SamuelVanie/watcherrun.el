# Task ID: INTEGRATION-002

**Title:** Create Documentation and Package Distribution Files

## Description
Create comprehensive documentation, README, and package distribution files following Emacs package standards. This includes user documentation, installation instructions, API documentation, and preparation for potential MELPA submission.

**Step-by-step breakdown:**
1. Create comprehensive README.md with installation and usage
2. Add inline documentation and improve docstrings
3. Create API documentation for extensibility
4. Add troubleshooting guide and FAQ
5. Prepare package for MELPA submission standards
6. Create example configurations and use cases

## Inputs
- All completed functionality and features
- Emacs package documentation standards
- MELPA submission requirements
- User experience and onboarding considerations

## Expected Output
- Comprehensive README.md
- Improved inline documentation and docstrings
- API documentation for developers
- Troubleshooting guide
- MELPA-ready package structure
- Example configurations and use cases

## Estimated Time
3 hours

## Component
['support_components']

## Level
junior

## Best Practices / Notes
- Follow standard Emacs package README format
- Include clear installation instructions for different methods
- Provide practical examples that users can copy-paste
- Document all interactive commands and their keybindings
- Add troubleshooting section for common issues
- Ensure all public functions have comprehensive docstrings

**README.md Structure:**
```markdown
# WatcherRun.el

Watch files and directories and run commands when they change.

## Features
- Watch individual files or entire directories
- Execute system commands or Emacs Lisp expressions
- Multiple concurrent compilation buffers (automatically renamed)
- Comprehensive error handling with dedicated error buffer
- Menu bar and Dired integration
- Session-only storage (no configuration files)

## Installation

### From MELPA
```elisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
(package-install 'watcherrun)
```

### Manual Installation
Clone this repository and add to your load path...

## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. Enable WatcherRun: `M-x watcherrun-mode`
2. Add a watcher: `C-c w a` or use the WatcherRun menu
3. Edit your file and watch the command execute automatically

### Examples
- JavaScript development: Watch `src/` directory, run `npm run build`
- Python testing: Watch `test_*.py` files, run `python {{file}}`
- Documentation: Watch `*.md` files, run `pandoc {{file}} -o {{basename}}.html`
```

**API Documentation:**
Document public functions for users who want to extend WatcherRun:
```elisp
;; Public API functions
(defun watcherrun-add-watcher (paths command command-type recursive)
  "Add a new file watcher.
PATHS is a list of file or directory paths to watch.
COMMAND is the command string to execute when files change.
COMMAND-TYPE is either 'system or 'lisp.
RECURSIVE determines if directories are watched recursively.
Returns watcher ID string.")
```

**Troubleshooting Guide:**
Common issues and solutions:
- File permissions issues
- Command not found errors
- Multiple compilation conflicts (explain the solution)
- Performance with large directories
- Platform-specific file watching limitations

**Example Configurations:**
```elisp
;; Web development setup
(defun my-web-dev-watchers ()
  "Set up watchers for web development."
  (interactive)
  (watcherrun-add-watcher '("src/") "npm run build" 'system t)
  (watcherrun-add-watcher '("test/") "npm test" 'system t))

;; Emacs Lisp development
(defun my-elisp-watchers ()
  "Set up watchers for Emacs Lisp development."
  (interactive)
  (watcherrun-add-watcher '("*.el") "(load-file \"{{file}}\")" 'lisp nil))
```

**MELPA Preparation:**
- Ensure package header is complete and correct
- Add Package-Requires with minimum Emacs version
- Verify all autoload cookies are in place
- Test package installation from scratch
- Check that package-lint passes without warnings

**Documentation Standards:**
- Every public function must have a comprehensive docstring
- Use standard Emacs documentation format
- Include parameter descriptions and return values
- Add usage examples where helpful
- Document any limitations or platform-specific behavior

**Dependencies:** Requires INTEGRATION-001 (final integration) to be completed first.
